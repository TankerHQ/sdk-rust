# Tanker Rust SDK

## Overview

The Tanker SDK provides an easy-to-use SDK allowing you to protect your users' data.

This repository only contains Rust bindings. The core library can be found in the [TankerHQ/sdk-native GitHub project](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-native).

## Documentation

Please see the [API documentation](https://docs.tanker.io/latest/api/core/rust) and the [implementation guides](https://docs.tanker.io/latest/guides/start/).

API documentation is also available through rustdoc, and can be viewed in your IDE.

## Contributing

We are actively working to allow external developers to build and test this project from source.
That being said, we welcome feedback on the Rust SDK, [bug reports](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-rust/issues),
and bug fixes in the form of [pull requests](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-rust/pulls).
